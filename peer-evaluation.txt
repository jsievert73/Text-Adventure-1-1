Peer's repository: https://github.com/inewhart/03-Text-adventure-1.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned a helpful reminder to be wary of local versus global variables. In lines 29 and 30, the quit will not affect the game,
because the variable at that point is only accessible by the update function, rather than the main function. 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
The .strip() and .upper() functions are both very useful functions that I would like to apply in the future.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
If you make quit a global variable at the start of the main file, you could make it so that the game will 
quit like it's supposed to on death or escape to the nearest town.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
The functions are very clear on what they should do as a whole, but it never hurts to comment and explain more complicated areas of the functions.
A great spot to try this would be lines 25-27 so that someone unfamiliar with your json file structure could understand what was going on.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Nope.
 

The repository contains an appropriate license.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
You could give a short description of your game as well.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
I greatly appreciate how succinct your code is.
It makes it easier to understand, edit, and fix when you write code in that fashion, so it's a great habit to get in and keep.
